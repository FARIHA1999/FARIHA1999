## <i>**Project:** ðŸš¦ Trip Assignment â€” Identifying the Optimum Commuting Route</i> <br>

**Description:**  
The last phase of the 4-step travel demand model that allocates **OD trips** to **routes** (by mode) and computes **link flows** on a multimodal networkâ€”often posed as a demandâ€“supply equilibrium problem.

---

<b>Problem Analysis</b>
- Determine each trip makerâ€™s likely **path choice** between all zone pairs *(i, j)* for each mode *k*.  
- Predict the resulting **link flows** *q<sub>ij</sub>* on the network of each mode.
