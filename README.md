## 📑 Research Experience  
<details>  
<summary><b>Thesis:</b> Exploring the Reasons Behind Land Cover Change & Evaluating Management Strategies of a Protected Area (2023–2024)</summary>  

**Objectives:**  
1. Investigate drivers of land cover change in Bhawal National Park.  
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of current management strategies.  

**Methodology:**  
- Data collection (satellite imagery + field survey).  
- GIS & statistical analysis. *(2 methodology images to be added)*  

**Results (Images to be inserted):**  
1. Social & Resource Map of Study Area  
2. Temporal Land Cover Change (2000–2020)  
3. Pairwise Matrix of Drivers  
4. Encroachment Analysis (989.36 acres illegally occupied, only 30% restored)  
5. Stakeholder Mapping & Effectiveness Assessment (only 30.13% effective)  

**Findings:**  
- Forestlands are increasingly encroached by industries & settlements.  
- Institutional capacity is weak; eviction cases largely ineffective.  
- Local communities excluded from decision-making.  
- Current management system is **ineffective for long-term conservation**.
